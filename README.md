# MFC-Assistant-Chrome-Extension
Chat bot for MFC.

# Myfreecams Assistant

The MFC Chat bot that puts you in charge of your room!

## Key Features:

* <b>Point and Click</b> - No confusing commands to learn. Just change a few options and then it's all point and click!
* <b>Ease of Use</b> - Our straight forward design makes the MFC Assistant extremely easy to learn!
* <b>Tip Wars</b> is a game where you to set 2 teams and a winning goal. Members support these teams	by tipping Even or Odd numbers until their team wins!
* <b>Token Keno</b> is a game where you set a range of numbers that your members can tip to win a prize. Prizes are randomly generated when the game starts and the game ends when all prizes have been won, and/or when all numbers have been tipped.
* <b>Saved/Timed Messages</b> - You can set saved messages that you can click to post them to your room. Alternatively, you can set them up on a timer so they automatically post at an interval you set! This is perfect for advertisements during your shows!
* <b>Actively Developed!</b> - There are certainly more features to come! I also look forward to your feedback!
